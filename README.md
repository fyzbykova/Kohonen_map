# Kohonen_map
Training a neural network to simulate a Kohonen network or map

The initial dataset is a matrix consisting of two columns (for example, a person's height and weight, age and income, test results in two different disciplines, etc.). The task is to divide the available data into several compact areas â€“ clusters. Set the possibility of changing the number of clusters.
Previously, it is necessary to normalize the available initial data to the scale [0, 1].
Use a graph to visualize the source data and the results obtained.
